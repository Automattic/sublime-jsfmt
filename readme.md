# jsfmt for sublime text

If you want your javascript automatically formatted to abide a particular style, then jsfmt is for you.  No need to read warnings and fix things yourself. Just keep it all auto. Boom boom [jsfmt](https://github.com/rdio/jsfmt) is pretty tight. And yeah, if you want it in Sublime Text this is your homeboy.

Save the file, it gets formatted.

### Installation

```bash
# install jsfmt module globally
npm install -g jsfmt

## go to your ST packages folder. maybe something like â€¦
cd ~/Library/"Application Support/Sublime Text 2"/Packages

# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/paulirish/sublime-jsfmt
```
I guess. 

This is very much NOT on package control because it its still a new thing. Try it out. If its working for you and you want to help run the show I'll transfer the repo to you and you can go to town. 

### Formatting rules

You can set global rules via a `.jsfmtrc`. Be crazy and establish one for all your projects in `~/.jsfmtrc`. (like in [my dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/blob/master/.jsfmtrc))

Otherwise you're probably pretty levelheaded and will probably provide one in your project root. It'll be read and applied.

Rules you can intuit from these [esformatter preset files](https://github.com/millermedeiros/esformatter/tree/master/lib/preset).

should work in both ST2 and ST3. I guess.
